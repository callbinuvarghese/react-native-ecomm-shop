# React Native App - API Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and update with your API URL

# === For Local Development (Windows/Mac) ===
# When running BOTH the backend AND the mobile app on the same machine:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# === For Testing on Physical Device ===
# When testing the mobile app on your phone (replace XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX with your computer's IP):
# EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:3000
# Example: EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.1.52:3000

# === For AURA Coding Space Backend ===
# When the backend is running in AURA Coding Space, use the AURA public URL:
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-aura-space-url.com

# To find your AURA Coding Space URL:
# 1. Make sure the Express server is running (npm run dev in express-server directory)
# 2. Look for the HTTPS URL in the AURA Coding Space ports panel
# 3. The URL will look like: https://3000-<your-space-id>.aura.com
